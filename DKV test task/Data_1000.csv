In an increasingly digital world, it's all too easy to lose your photos to the cloud or to the depths of your camera roll, never to be seen again. So we decided to do something about it. Popsa launched in 2016 to bring your memories to life by printing them in beautiful, physical products that you can hold. However, instead of making you spend hours designing your product (like Snapfish or Photobox), we do the hard work for you in minutes. Our vision is to send you regular bundles of photos in the post without you having to think about it. Little presents to yourself. A monthly subscription to your memories. We're developing technology to make it happen: • Machine learning to curate your most sentimental photos. • Bespoke algorithms to automatically design beautiful layouts. • The fastest delivery from the best printers in the world. Customers will sign up and every month they'll unwrap a new collection of memories to keep for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software","Artificial Intelligence, E-Commerce, Machine Learning, Printing, Retail Technology",2,"Liam Houghton, Tom Cohen",11-50,4,Early Stage Venture,2022-02-03,9000000,GBP,12238237,Series B,9000000,GBP,12238237,Series B,15840000,GBP,21307623,15840000,GBP,21307623,"500 Global, Pembroke VCT, Guinness Ventures, octopus investments, Gresham House Ventures",3,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20,808","20,705",,0,-0.1,0.6,18,"Engineering, Management, Operations",15,,"96,213","60,735.83",10.38%,158,-15.51%,1.8,-15.9%,60.42%,20.77%,"400,526","-10,437",-2.54%,63,,"88,849",24

Not so much an asset, more of a liability. With the help of e-commerce expert Rob, the pair realised that a car-sharing app (an ‘AirBnB for cars’) might offer a smarter, more environmentally friendly way for people in Britain to hire the 10 million cars rented here every year. The pair began work in August 2014, and it soon became clear that the obstacle to unlocking the value in people’s cars was simple: the keys, and the time it took to hand them over. The team worked on an app-controlled box which allowed users to unlock cars direct from the app. The QuickStart® box was born. Rob and Graeme hired their first employee in 2016, and have watched hiyacar evolve into a friendly, living community, and a company of 16 people. hiyacar still puts people first - and unlike others they were born and bred in Britain. Each hiyacar shared could take the equivalent of 11 vehicles off the road. People are getting to know their neighbours, too. Hiya Owners add personal touches, such as putting ribbons on a car for a wedding.

The produce is organic, fresh, and seasonal. Gousto’s recipes are developed by a team of passionate chefs and tested by all their friends and families first (very picky people). You get to choose the recipes online and every week the selection is updated to make sure there’re plenty of new recipes for you. The recipes are delivered right to your doorstep once a week so you decide when to cook. Whenever you’re on holiday or just don’t have time, simply place the subscription on hold – it’s easy. Gousto was started in 2011 by two friends who share a passion for food and cooking. In their previous lives, Timo and James loved cooking but didn’t have much time to go to various grocery shops. They found it difficult to cook recipes from online databases or follow cook-along TV shows. Ready-meals from supermarkets do the job but the quality isn’t great, they have lots of additives, and they get boring very easily. One day, James and Timo decided that there must be some way to make life easier and the idea for Gousto was born. The first recipes were offered at market stalls and from there the concept has grown into what you see today. Of course, all of Timo and James' friends are Gousto guinea pigs.

We refurbish and rebox used devices into premium phones - making it easier, faster, and more trustworthy. So fewer perfectly good phones go to waste. And one by one, we can save millions more from landfill. Our circular business model – rebox, rehome, repeat – isn’t just designed to give our customers better value, but make a positive impact on the environment and society.  We don’t just reward people for reboxing. We reward the planet by planting 10 trees every time we buy or sell a device and paying to offset each phone’s lifetime CO2 emissions, which helps to fund a whole range of projects to cut CO2. Our goal is to try and make every phone we rehome not just carbon neutral, but carbon positive if we can. We've come to shake up a dated and boring category. To solve inefficiencies. To redefine recommerce. To challenge the status quo. To liberate people from their addiction to linear, and create a circular economy that rewards them for making greener choices and helping to replenish the planet. One device at a time.

Verado is changing the rules of the game - It’s simplicity, re-engineered. We believe selling should be as seamless as buying.

Provenance of food is now a huge consideration for consumers. There is an increasing distrust of the industrial food supply chain and a trend amongst consumers to be more informed about the food quality. This trend has coincided with a loss of high street butchers and an increase in online shopping. This creates the perfect opportunity for The Ethical Butcher. Food Ethics and sustainability are topics which are increasingly important to the British public. The Ethical Butcher demonstrates that eating meat can be both healthy for the public and the environment if animals are kept properly. The Ethical Butcher will campaign against factory farming in preference for Pasture For Life and holistically managed animals. The Ethical Butcher's meat is free from growth hormones and antibiotics.   The Ethical Butcher will support the Pasture-Fed Livestock Association's campaign to challenge DEFRA’s (Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs) rules for food labelling with respect of grass-fed meat. Meat in the UK can be labelled as grass-fed if only 51% of its diet has been grass. This results in a very different product from 100% pasture fed meat. Pasture-fed animals are healthier, the meat is better for us and the carbon footprint is significantly reduced.  The British public has become more invested in their fitness, health and nutrition. The Ethical Butcher's 100% pasture fed meats offer a nutritionally superior product to factory farmed meats. Pasture fed meat does not cause the equivalent inflammation in the human body as low quality, factory farmed produce. The Ethical Butcher’s meat is suitable for people on a Primal / Paleo / FODMAP/ Ketogenic / whole food or clean eating diet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage","E-Commerce, Food and Beverage, Food Processing",2,"Farshad Kazemian, Glen Burrows",1-10,2,,2021-07-09,1235290,GBP,1717942,Equity Crowdfunding,1235290,GBP,1717942,Equity Crowdfunding,1569930,GBP,2181453,1569930,GBP,2181453,Crowdcube,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"98,307","97,067",,1.9,1.6,0,4,Finance,1,,"18,407","14,635.17",65.11%,110,-47.62%,3.11,-19.38%,64.01%,1.3%,"1,311,086","-369,672",-21.99%,40,,,

Retail customers are going mobile, but many retailers haven’t worked out how to turn high volumes of engagement on mobile into conversions. Every retailer knows they should have a great mobile website, but many aren't aware of how mobile apps can drive engagement and revenue from their most loyal customers - and most aren't taking advantage of technologies - like personalization algorithms and push notifications - that are proven to drive revenue and engagement on mobile. For retailers who are convinced of the value of a mobile app, getting one to market that’s properly integrated with their existing systems, scalable and future proofed can be difficult. Bijou Commerce solves this by providing high performing mobile apps as a cloud solution, allowing retailers to launch deeply integrated apps without major disruption to their tech roadmap. Bijou integrates deeply into retailers' existing e-commerce systems via easy-to-install plugins, and synchronises the all the key product, stock, order and user information in real time.

The platform signals the end of old stacks of paper takeaway menus and the need to pick up the phone, whilst the website and mobile apps make food ordering an easy, convenient experience with no additional cost to the customer. hungryhouse was launched in 2006 by co-founders Shane Lake and Tony Charles. hungryhouse really began to receive attention after appearing on BBC1's Dragons Den in 2007, when James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne offered to invest £100,000 in the business. The deal later fell through but enabled Shane and Tony to secure investment from elsewhere and begin to scale the business.  The first mobile app for iPhone was launched in 2011 and Android followed close behind. In 2013 hungryhouse became part of the global Delivery Hero group, the world's largest online food ordering network.  Following the merger hungryhouse benefited from a $285 million investment into the Delivery Hero network and grew rapidly in terms of size and capability. hungryhouse hit profitability in Q3 2013 ahead of a rebrand which totally overhauled the brand identity and upgraded the mobile and online platforms.  As part of the renewed focus on ease and performance, the brand adopted the slogan ""Your hunger. Our Mission"" and launched a nationwide TV and marketing campaign in December 2013. The aim was to raise awareness of hungryhouse in every household in the UK and bring better food to the people. Today, the platform boasts a loyal customer base and over 10,000 UK restaurant partners, ensuring it is easy for customers to discover new cuisines or choose from local favourites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Internet Services, Transportation","Delivery Service, E-Commerce, Restaurants, Search Engine",2,"Shane Lake, Tony Charles",51-100,1,M&A,2008-05-09,100000,GBP,194937,Angel,100000,GBP,194937,Angel,100000,GBP,194937,100000,GBP,194937,,,,,Was Acquired,hungryhouse acquired by Just Eat,https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/just-eat-com-acquires-hungryhouse-co-uk--92fc50c3,Just Eat,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/just-eat-com,2016-12-15,day,200000000,GBP,248480232,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"147,477","144,754",,0.4,1,0,3,,,,"5,623",,,42,,2,,0%,,"2,597,832",,,18,3,,19

However, only 26% are actually buying from such purpose-driven brands. The reason for this, fundamentally, is that people don't believe that they can make a difference. At Epic Impact we want to change that. We have a vision of a world where every time we spend money, we have a positive impact on humanity, nature and the environment. This is why we have created a new category of lifestyle tool; Personal Impact Management. With a Personal Impact Management solution like Epic's, consumers can better understand, manage and improve the impact that they have on the world around them. Through our mobile app, consumers can: - Let us know what values are important to them, to personalise their Epic Impact experience - Explore a directory of vetted ethical, sustainable merchants, covering categories such as clothing & accessories, homeware, renewable energy, food, and holidays. - Earn real-time, automated rewards whenever they make a purchase from an Epic Impact Rewards merchant. - Use those rewards to donate to charities or offset carbon emissions. - Track the contribution their day-to-day spending make towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For merchants, Epic Impact provides: - a no-code integration rewards platform for e-commerce and epos systems that can connect to over 550 solutions, including Shopify, Squarespace, Magento 2, WooCommerce and WIX, and be launched in minutes. - a loyalty rewards platform designed to build values-based relationship with their customers, from exclusive offers, to gift cards, to interactive digital receipts. There is, understandably, a lot of focus on the major issue of climate change and carbon emissions, which is driving an increase in top-down solutions that aim to help consumers reduce their carbon footprint. However, for the majority of consumers, when it comes to the moment of purchase, it is convenience and affordability that are the primary concern, not the carbon footprint of their purchase. Furthermore, being carbon neutral will become as mandatory for merchants as having a website and a social media presence, so what will cause long-term loyalty with companies that have purpose at their core? The answer lies in the alignment of values between merchant and consumer, such as ocean conservation, wildlife protection, the reduction in people suffering hunger and living in poverty. Where Epic Impact differs is that we are taking a bottom up approach, focusing on empowering consumers to support the causes that they care about when they shop. Then, through a growing network effect, this momentum of buying better will support not just reducing carbon emissions, but also creating a cleaner, fairer world for all of humanity, nature and the environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sales and Marketing, Sustainability","E-Commerce, Loyalty Programs, Social Impact, Sustainability",2,"Grant Calton, James Brown",1-10,3,Seed,2021-03-01,140000,GBP,195004,Seed,140000,GBP,195004,Seed,535000,GBP,718688,535000,GBP,718688,"F10, Startupbootcamp Australia, Nigel Wray, Shaz Sulaman, Curt Hopkins",2,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"151,837","148,955",,0.2,0,-0.2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,

Sellers can choose from one of three auction types - blind auctions have confidential bids, alternatively public auctions allow all interested buyers to see the bid history. Standard auctions have fixed end times, in an extended auction, the end time increases automatically each time a bid is received near the end - this is to allow other buyers a chance to respond to the new bid and encourages bidders to bid early. Sellers get bids directly from buyers - allowing them to stay in control of their property sale. Even if they need to change estate agents - they will still be able to keep previous buyers notified about the auction end.

It will allow food delivery businesses to borrow and lend drivers from one another at short notice. In addition, GPS tracking will provide full visibility of all orders.  One member generates revenue from otherwise redundant resource while the other is able to keep their customer satisfied. Food delivery businesses can't always predict when there will be a surge in the number of orders received and as such struggle to meet customer expectations with timely deliveries. One of the key contributors to this is the limited access to delivery drivers. Further, the majority don't have access to an affordable solution to track their drivers which then makes the dispatch process inefficient. The Delivery Club technology platform is being designed to tackle both of these challenges, providing a holistic solution. With the comfort that they can access drivers when needed, we believe these businesses would be more inclined to increase their marketing spend and grow their businesses. Further, they would have the ability to earn money towards the cost of their delivery drivers when they would otherwise be idle. The GPS tracking would allow them to run a more efficient dispatch process and increase customer satisfaction levels.

MadBid.com has over 750,000 auction winners internationally and over 3 million registered users. MadBid.com operates across Europe in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, France, Turkey, Austria, The Netherlands as well as the UK where the company is based. How it works - Based on the penny auction concept MadBid.com brings gamification to shopping. There are 4 ways to shop on MadBid: 1. Bid in Auctions: Customers need to purchase credits in order to participate in the auctions. Auction winners walk away with significant discounts on branded products like Apple, Samsung and even cars. All MadBid auctions have timers that count down, an auction winner is determined when the timer runs out and no-one else places a Bid. When someone places a Bid the timer re-starts and counts down again, at which point the auction price goes up by 1p only, thus keeping the final closing price much lower than the RRP of the product.  2. Buy Now: If users do not win the auction, they can use all the spent credits in that auction as discount of the RRP of the product so they can purchase it.  3. Earned Discount: If users do not wish to pay the difference between spent credits and RRP, they can simply use the value of the spent credits in the auction to purchase any product from the Earned Discount selection. 4. Simply Click and Buy: Users do not need to participate in auctions, they can simply purchase products with a simple click and buy.

Quickly outgrowing this floating jungle, Beth joined Google for StartUps Female Founder program in 2019 and officially launched the e-commerce, subscription & B2B offering in October 2020. Leaf Envy is based in London, United Kingdom and delivers across the UK.  In 2020, they launched a B2B Plant Installation & Maintenance service and have worked with a range of brands including Google, Grind Coffee, Soho Home and Accenture to name a few.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Other","B2B, Consumer Goods, E-Commerce, Subscription Service",1,Beth Chapman,1-10,1,,2019-01-01,,,,Non-equity Assistance,,,,,,,,,,,Google for Startups,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"197,714","192,622",,3.4,4.5,3.8,6,Operations,1,,"28,719","32,899.83",18.64%,379,110.56%,2.43,-14.14%,60.72%,-11.4%,"940,040","-58,938",-5.9%,50,,,
